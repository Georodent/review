# Design 1-Header

1.  This would be a good amount of work. Not too much, and not too little. It seems pretty basic. I would make the curve on the actual image, and match the color to the background-color of the body. This way it would look seamless. 


2. There is one option I can think of for less work. The nav could be a bootstrap nav. Otherwise, it's pretty straight forward, and seems like an easy code up.


3. This is a really great design, IMO. Suttle and eye catching, great placement of items, and the color scheme is perfect. 


4. Create a top Nav with flexbox. Edit image with the curve on the bottom using a line object, and filling the color to match the body background. Have an article, and an aside. etc....


# Design 2 SignUp 01


1. This looks like it would take some time. Looks nice and challenging. A good amount of JS would more than likely be required. 


2. Did not find any options to make this less work. 


3. This is a good design. I like the colors, and the form has a sort of cartoony look. It's clean and precise, easy to read. One concern is the 2 submit buttons? Also, if there is a reason for 2 of them, they need to be clarified to the user.


4. Create a background image, and a form container. Suggest making them modules to reuse for signup 02. 


# Design 3 SignUp 02


1. Not too much. Can make signup01 with modules, and reuse most of that code.  


2. Same as signup 01. Just some different info inside the container for the form. Looks good, and seems pretty easy.


3. Great site, clean and very attractive. The only concern is disabling the back browser button. Seems to be not a good idea. Maybe just alert the user instead. 


4. Grab code from signup01. Redo info inside forms, and redo styling as well.
