# Design 1-Header

1.  This would be a good amount of work. Not too much, and not too little. It seems pretty basic. I would make the curve on the actual image, and match the color to the background-color of the body. This way it would look seamless. 


2. There are a few options for less work. The nav could be a bootstrap nav. Otherwise, it's pretty straight forward, and seems like an easy code up.


3. This is a really great design, IMO. Suttle and eye catching, great placement of items, and the color scheme is perfect. 


4. Create a top Nav with flexbox. Edit image with the curve on the bottom using a line object, and filling the color to match the body background. Have an article, and an aside. etc....
